    HWIHVA provides various interactive charts and graphs to help you understand performance patterns and trends.

    *   **Accessing Visualizations:** Use the main navigation menu (e.g., "Visualizations," "Player Stats," "Team Stats") to find the specific charts you need.
    *   **Interacting with Charts:**
        *   **Hover:** Move your mouse cursor over data points (like bars, lines, or dots) on a chart to see specific values or details in a tooltip.
        *   **Click:** Click on elements (like legend items) to highlight or filter data directly within the chart. Some charts might allow clicking on data points to drill down further.
        *   **Zoom/Pan:** Some charts (especially time-series or heatmaps) may allow you to zoom in on specific areas or pan across the view for closer inspection. Look for zoom icons or use mouse scroll/drag actions if enabled.
    *   **Available Visualization Types (Examples):**
        *   **Player Performance Trends:** Line charts showing individual player stats (goals, assists, shots, etc.) over time (games or seasons).
        *   **Heatmaps:** Visual representations of data density on the ice (e.g., shot locations, zone entries/exits).
        *   **Team Stat Comparisons:** Bar charts or radar charts comparing team performance metrics across different games, seasons, or against opponents.
        *   **Possession Metrics:** Charts visualizing Corsi, or other relevant possession statistics.

*   **Filtering and Comparing Data**
    Refine your analysis by focusing on specific segments of the data.

    *   **Using Filter Controls:** Look for filter panels or dropdown menus, typically located near the visualizations or in a dedicated sidebar. Common filters include:
        *   **Season:** Select one or more seasons.
        *   **Player:** Choose specific players to analyze.
        *   **Game Type:** Filter by Regular Season, Playoffs, Exhibition, etc.

        *   **Date Range:** Select specific periods.

    *   **Comparing Players, Seasons, or Games:**
        *   Use the filter controls to select multiple items you want to compare (e.g., select two players in the Player filter).
        *   The visualizations will often update automatically to show side-by-side comparisons or overlapping data series for the selected items.

*   **Predictive Analytics**
    Leverage historical data to generate forecasts for future performance.

    *   **Accessing Predictions:** Navigate to the "Predictive Analytics" section via the main menu.
    *   **Understanding Forecasts:**
        *   Select the parameters for your prediction
        *   The application will display the predicted outcomes, often accompanied by confidence intervals or probability scores. These indicate the model's certainty level.
        *   Predictions might cover areas like: potential goal scoring, points projection, or team win probability based on certain factors.
    *   **Important Considerations:**
        *   Predictive models are based on **historical data and statistical algorithms**. They identify patterns but **cannot guarantee future results**.
        *   Performance can be influenced by numerous factors not always captured in the data (e.g., injuries, team chemistry changes, opponent adjustments).
        *   Use predictions as an **additional tool** to inform strategy and expectations, not as definitive outcomes.

*   **Navigating the Application**
    *   Use the main navigation menu (often at the top or side of the screen) to move between major sections (Dashboard, Visualizations, Predictions, etc.).
    *   Look for standard web interface elements like buttons, links, dropdown menus, and forms to interact with the application.
